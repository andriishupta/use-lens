# Use Lens

List of libraries that hold generated Lens API in form of hooks

Todo: 
- write script to update SCHEMA
- write script to update API: parse all existing pages from docs.lens.xyz
- use codegen.ts for .env file
- add CLI for eject and add more flexibility: `use-lens react-apollo`
  - by "name" load codegen and GQL documents(from github) and add .use-lens.json file to hold name and version for clarity

- lens api and documents should be generated and committed and use-lens.json should be added with when it has been generated.
