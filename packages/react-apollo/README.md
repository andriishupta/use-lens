# WIP until v1.0.1: @use-lens/react-apollo
Lens API generated code for Apollo Client in React.

## ⚠️ CAUTION
🌿 https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/introduction:
> This API is beta and not production complete yet, which means that we could change schemas and endpoints at any time without warning or notice to you. When this API is production ready, we will remove this beta warning and will endeavor to ensure that there are no changes going forward unless a major change to the protocol itself is required.

Lens API is not production complete, so as `@use-lens/*`. Please, keep this in mind when going to production.

In case of Breaking Changes please, visit main [README.md's FAQ](https://github.com/use-lens/use-lens#%EF%B8%8F-faq)

There is an explanation of how I see best use of `@use-lens/*` at this point in main [README.md](https://github.com/use-lens/use-lens#-usage)

## 🤓 Usage
- Install package
```
npm install --save @use-lens/react-apollo
```
- Add Apollo: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started

```typescript jsx
// add example
